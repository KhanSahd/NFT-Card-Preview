### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query for mobile view

### What I learned

Doing this challenge, I really improved at the speed of which I can develop a website simply by looking at a picture of a page.
I reall enjoyed doing this project because it involved flexbox and I feel like it's always a good idea to practice developing with flexbox because it simply makes it easier to lay out a page how it needs to be done. I took this project on to further develop my CSS skills.

### Continued development

Some areas I want to focus on in my development career going forward are:
- improving my flexbox and CSS grid skills.
- I want to become more advanced and efficent at setting the approprate margin and padding styles.
- CSS transitions
